# Donor3 - donating made easy.

Every year, billions of donations go unspent–not because people don't care, but because the process is broken. Donors struggle to find trustworthy organizations, verify causes, and manually make payments. It's fragmented, frustrating, and outdated.

This is where Donor3 comes in. It's an AI-powered platform where users type how they want to help, for example: "I wanna donate 100 dollars to help refugees." We instantly match them with verified charities, handle the payments, and show them their impact—all in one seamless flow.

So why now? AI has made text parsing effortless. Payment APIs are better than every and still evolving. And younger generations expect donating to be as intuitive as sending a text. We're making that happen.

Anyone can help. One message, instant impact. Let's revolutionize donating with Donor3.
