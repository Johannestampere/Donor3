# Theory for this

## Blockchain

Blockchain is a decentralized, digital ledger technology that securely records data across a network of computers in a way that is:

Immutable – Once recorded, data cannot be easily changed or deleted.

Transparent – All participants can see the data (in public blockchains).

Distributed – No single party controls the entire system.

Each "block" contains:

A list of transactions or data,

A timestamp,

A unique cryptographic hash,

The hash of the previous block (linking them together).

This forms a chain of blocks—hence the name. It's used in cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin and Ethereum), supply chain tracking, voting systems, and secure digital contracts.

## Smart contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing programs on a blockchain that automatically run when predefined conditions are met — without needing a third party.
They are
- immutable
- distributed
- transparent

## Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized network where code runs via smart contracts

ETH is the native currency

Every user and contract has an address

Transactions cost gas (paid in ETH)

## Solidity

A statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum.
